i'm making a hackpad and facing my hesitation cuz of the coding part 


after thinking it through i decieded on making a 3x3 macropad with no oled screen and i'll be using the pin method instead of matrix
starting at 2026/1/4 1:36 am


i've just made the schematic and connected all the parts 2040 microcontroller and the 9 buttons and an important note i left sda and scl floating and preserved if i switch up my mind and the oled screen back who knows what could happen later

guess what it's 2:22 am and i alr changed my mind and added oled display tho i feel like i'll regret it later lol

starting with pcb step at 2:33 am 
finished the layout and connection step at 3:42 am 

![connected](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e72e8bc9-91e9-4c36-b4c2-398e1a16c93f)

did some sligh modifications on the routing system gave more space between lines and increased width to be more durabale 
and branded it and i call it the kpad k as in kaito

i've been trying to setup fusion 360 for a while now and i just gave up it's 5:32 am alr, i'm using linux and on an old laptop i've been trying got long time and i decided to switch to freecad instead and i alr installed it. i'll add screw holes to the pcb design and then export pcb.step to do the 3d model in freecad i feel like i'll take a break watching some freecad tuts or just sleep alr cuz i'm tired and continue tmrr which is today alr lol my sleep schedule is messed up fr the crazy thing that i was a morning bird , (btw i miss u bitsy if u reading this ly)

i added the screw holes and added the 3d moedels to freecad i'll cont when i wake up cuz i obv k nothing about freecad see ya end of session at 2026/1/4 6:1 am
------------------------------------
it's 2026/1/5 and i've been working on the 3d enclosure for hours now it's not fun at all it's actually torturing the worst experience till now, what i thought would be the easiest is actually the worst ngl i've used blender before so i knew what was waiting for me but omg i'e always hated 3d modeling alot of complexity for no reason and the control system is so messed up and complicated and u need to learn each button first etc and i don't like that i just like to dive in and use the software immediately and only learning what i need but this ins't the case with those software they were made to be pain in the back that's what i managed to do after all that time and the silly errors that make no sense not even mentioning that fusion didn't work on my laptop and had to switch to freecad which still almost the same thing i'm really off now it even got me thinking of dumping the whole project tho i alr finished the pcb, if i still got soul in me i'll prob try to change the software and give it one last chance

GUESSS WHAT i'm back and i did it i made the 3d model omd , i just finshed rn it's 4:53 am 

![done 3d model](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c34c2d5-cde5-44fa-8ae0-2523493f4555)
that's the case only i alr exported the parts and this is the preview 
i'll go to the coding part now and then i hope i'd still have some life in me and sumbit it (btw i got chemistry at 10 am lol)
